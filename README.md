## ATTENTION
Any further development is now posted over at https://github.com/Gamebunn/Cream64_PC, this repo is no longer in use. 

## Super Cream 64 - The Grand Finale 
A fork of [AloXado320/sm64ex-alo](https://github.com/AloXado320/sm64ex-alo), which is a fork of [sm64pc/sm64ex](https://github.com/sm64pc/sm64ex) with additional features. 

Overall additions since the last build: 

* You can now finally fly! Originally made for Cream 64, introduced in Chao Bandstand and now it's finally here. Works like Sonic Heroes: get about 3-4 seconds of total flight time. When you're not moving, you lose no stamina.
* Be whoever you wanna be! Bunch of alt outfits are available for you to choose from the very start. (PC Version only): Each alt has its own matching Cheese alt and a handful have a custom Vanilla alt.
* Brand new levels replacing three existing levels: Secret Aquarium, Vanish Cap under the Moat and Wing Mario over the Rainbow. Each still have a single secret star and the vanish switch is still there too.
* Music has been updated. Mostly the same but with some new tracks scattered here and there. A bit more variety now with a few repeats. 
* Gemerl is now actually beatable in the rematch. And even if you're struggling, you can always fly around on the other side.
* Tails, Blaze and Marine have their own little side stories now alongside Amy. The number of encounters is now listed at the end of each of their dialog boxes.
* And some smaller fixes
 
 ## Building SC64
 
 Make sure to grab the latest version of MSYS2 from their website. Seems that initial bug has been fixed now and the latest version should be able to compile hacks now.
 
 If you haven't built with the normal sm64ex/sm64ex-alo builds, [look at those first for a proper tutorial and getting the proper dependencies for install](https://github.com/sm64pc/sm64ex/wiki/Compiling-on-Windows). Then once you got the hang of it, come back here. 
 
 1) do ```git clone https://github.com/Gamebunn/sm64ex-alo.git``` to somewhere on your PC with MSYS2. Make sure it's a directory with full access. Then `cd sm64ex-alo` to get into the folder itself.
 2) download the extra assets needed for the repo. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-TAw3tel0Xaj6LZF4KMWoa5NqFSIYsiN/view?usp=sharing
 3) find your own US copy of sm64, rename it to baserom.us.z64 and put it in the root of your clone.
 4) dump the contents of the assets folder into the root of where you cloned the git
 5) go ahead and compile with ```make```. If you got a decent CPU, you can increase the compile speed with ```make -j4```.
 
 Helpful build additions:
 
 HIGH_FPS_PC=1 - Game runs at 60 FPS
 
 NODRAWINGDISTANCE=1 - All objects are shown at all times
 
 Example: ```make NODRAWINGDISTANCE=1 -j4```

Currently the only build that works for this is just for PC. The others have not been tested and are not guaranteed to work. If you do wish to try, go right away. If you're also just looking for the N64 build, [it's available right here.](https://romhacking.com/hack/super-cream-64)

## Known Bugs

* Certain stars show up transparent even when not collected (Visual bug): Aware but not sure what's going on. Still functions properly otherwise. 
* Going to the Displays option crashes the game (SM64EX conflict): Since sm64ex-alo removed a setting in display (3 point filter for textures), the game doesn't know what to do and crashes. The current fix is to just delete your `sm64config.txt` file in `Appdata/Roaming/sm64ex` and let it generate a new one. 

## Building
 ### Clone the repository:

 ```sh
 git clone https://github.com/AloXado320/sm64ex-alo
 cd sm64ex-alo
 ```
 
 **Note:** On Unix systems you may need to do this before doing any changes:
 
 ```sh
 git config core.fileMode false
 chmod -R 777 .
 ```
 
 ### Copy baserom(s) for asset extraction:
 
 For each version (jp/us/eu/sh) for which you want to build an executable, put an existing ROM at `./baserom.<VERSION>.z64` for asset extraction.
 
 By default it builds the US version.

  **Note:** Only tested in WSL, works on (Debian / Ubuntu) as well, other distros untested.

  #### Install build dependencies:
  ```sh
  sudo apt install -y binutils-mips-linux-gnu build-essential git libcapstone-dev pkgconf python3 gcc-mips-linux-gnu
  ```

  #### Build:
  ```sh
  # if you have more cores available, you can increase the -j parameter
  make -j4 TARGET_N64=1 
  ```
 
  #### ROM location:
  ```sh
  build/us/sm64.us.f3dzex.z64
  ```

  <summary>To build for Android, click here.</summary>
 
  **Note:** Only Termux build is supported.
 
  #### Install Termux
 
  Install the app from F-Droid [here](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/)
 
  Make sure you use this version, as the Google Play version is outdated.

  #### Install build dependencies
  ```sh
  pkg install git wget make python getconf zip apksigner clang binutils
  ```

  #### Copy in your baserom:

  Do this using your default file manager (on AOSP, you can slide on the left and there will be a "Termux" option there), or using Termux.
  ```sh
  termux-setup-storage
  cp /sdcard/path/to/your/baserom.z64 ./baserom.us.z64
  ```

  #### Install external dependencies
  ```sh
  cd platform/android/ && ./getkhrplatform.sh && ./getSDL.sh && cd ../..
  ```
 
  #### Build
  ```sh
  # if you have more cores available, you can increase the -j parameter
  # On Termux, TARGET_ANDROID=1 is defined automatically in Makefile
  make -j4
  ```

 #### Install apk:
  ```sh
  xdg-open build/us_android/sm64.us.f3dex2e.apk
  ```
